# MAGASIN Business OS — Task Queue

**Plan:** BOS V1 / 21 days  
**Rule:** mỗi implementation task mục tiêu <= ~20 phút active work; lớn hơn phải chia.

TASK-026 remains a valid Owner decision pack but is deferred; it no longer blocks the enterprise queue. Architecture execution is now schedule-first under `00_ARCHITECTURE_5_STEP_RESET.md`. Every new task must pass QUESTION → DELETE → SIMPLIFY → ACCELERATE → AUTOMATE before implementation.

## Execution rule

Task tiếp theo chỉ chạy khi task hiện tại đạt Definition of Done hoặc được chuyển rõ sang `WAIT_USER` / `BLOCKED`.

Supervisor chỉ auto-continue khi `00_PROJECT_STATE.json` cho phép.
